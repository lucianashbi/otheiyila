So this is exactly what has gone down as I await my new companion computer (silly name, I know). I bought the computer, a case, and a power source. My intention is to run Android 7 on it. So, I found a Android 7.0 image file (that was compressed twice) and extracted it to get to the image file itself. Then I used Win32 image writer to write the image file to a 32 GB microSD card. So far: The SD card has some 21GB of unallocated space. A partition labeled "Boot", another 500 mb parti.

Can someone please explain to me what is the difference between writing an iso image with a product like win32 image writer vs using something like universal USB installer? I am just trying to create a live USB and I can get both to work, but when I use image writer it creates two partitions (one of which I can't resize with partition wizard) whereas with universal USB installer it creates one partition that I can resize without a problem. I just want to understand why there is a difference.

For work, I've been tasked with creating a custom embedded Linux distribution for a new unit. So far I've been able to configure and compile my kernel and the root file system, which I now need to transfer to an SD card to test on the target hardware. This is where the complicated bit is. My development environment is a server with IT, meaning I don't have physical access to it to write the files to the sdcard. The only thing I have is my Windows machine with win32 image writer.

I've tried multiple times with multiple PCs and multiple USBs (even multiple distros) to install Debian on my thinkpad. First things first: I disabled safe boot, saved the changes. Then I entered my boot menu and selected my USB drive. I got multiple results: first: when I select my usb drive in the boot menu, screen goes black, as if its loading and then comes back to the boot menu after few seconds. second: when I got it to work, I entered the installation menu and after selecting language.

Update: Ok, I just formatted the card using the SD Card Formatter and Win32 Image Writer (on my work laptop) and it seems to be booting up fine now. I'm going to chalk it up to a problem either with my distro formatting the card or writing the image. I wonder what it could be. for what it's worth, I'm running Fedora 23 Workstation with the latest updates. Hi all, I decided to jump on the RPI bandwagon!

The T450/T450s are some of the best value Thinkpads out there on eBay and on the used market in general, but they are plagued by the notorious screen whitelist, which means unless you get an OEM Lenovo FRU panel replacement, you are going to have a hard time getting screen brightness controls working in Windows when you inevitably upgrade to a FHD IPS panel. In addition, the BEST FHD IPS panel available for the T450/T450s -- Innolux N140HCE-EN1 REV. C2 -- is not a compatible FRU for the T450/T. Something I have noticed among quite a few of us Sysadmins is that many us rolling out Windows 10 are are trying to make Windows 10 as much like Windows 7 as possible. For example, many Sysadmins are stripping as many UWP apps from Windows 10 as possible, and only loading the same applications they used on Windows 7 onto Windows 10. Some sysadmins are also trying to disable as many cloud services in Windows 10 as possible. Some sysadmins also block the Microsoft Store or remove the Store I've had multiple people (mostly new XP users) on this sub ask me what software is available for XP. I've been answering by saying that there's an XP version of virtually all Windows software, and that you can find an XP program to accomplish just abut anything you'd ever want to accomplish on a PC. I've since realized that this leaves them with no starting point and no examples of software a person might want/need to have installed, so I'm posting a small number of recommendations or examples.
